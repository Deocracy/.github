# Versioning and Roadmap

This Wiki page explains our versioning strategy and provides an overview of the project roadmap, including planned features and version milestones.

## Versioning Strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our project, which follows the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each number is incremented as follows:

1. `MAJOR` version when there are incompatible API changes,
2. `MINOR` version when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when bug fixes are made in a backwards-compatible manner.

## Project Roadmap

### Pre-Alpha Demo Parts (FEATURE NAME v0)

_Pre-Alpha demo parts are early-stage features or proof-of-concept implementations that help us validate ideas and collect feedback._

- Feature A (v0)
- Feature B (v0)
- Feature C (v0)

### Working Alpha (v0.0.1)

_Working Alpha versions are the first iterations of the project with minimum viable features, suitable for early adopters and testing._

- Feature A with basic functionality
- Initial UI design
- Basic API integrations

### Beta (v0.1.0)

_Beta versions include improvements based on feedback from Alpha users, and additional features that enhance the project's usability._

- Improved Feature A and B integration
- Refined UI/UX design
- Expanded API functionality
- Performance optimizations

### Official Release (v1.0.0)

_The official release marks a stable version of the project with all planned features implemented and tested, ready for public use._

- Polished UI/UX design
- Full feature set implemented
- Comprehensive documentation
- Seamless integration with third-party services

### Planned Features (Not Yet Included in a Specific Version)

_These are features that we have planned for future development but haven't assigned to a specific version yet._

1. **Feature D**: _Outline goal and description for Feature D._
2. **Feature E**: _Outline goal and description for Feature E._
3. **Feature F**: _Outline goal and description for Feature F._

Please note that the roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, technical constraints, and project priorities.
