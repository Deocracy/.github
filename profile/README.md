# We believe in a future where society is democratized, open and secure.

Deocracy Institute is a {charitable nonprofit 501c3} that seeks to bring democracy to sectors of society that have not yet been reached, known as decentralization. We explore new technologies and collaborate on projects to create opportunities for everyone. Publishing news about these emerging technologies allows you to stay informed about what matters most in order to transform societyâ€™s governance so profoundly, we marvel at how we managed without it.
